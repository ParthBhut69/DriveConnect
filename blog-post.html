     <p>Owning a car should be convenient ‚Äî but maintaining it often isn‚Äôt.
      Most car owners struggle with:
      <ul>
        <li>Not knowing which garages are reliable.</li>
        <li>Getting inconsistent prices for the same service.</li>
        <li>Wasting time visiting multiple workshops.</li>
        <li>No proper online system to compare quality, reviews, or transparency in work.</li>
      </ul>
      We saw this every day in cities like Pune, where car culture is growing rapidly ‚Äî yet the servicing experience hasn‚Äôt evolved.
      So we decided to change it.</p>`,
